# Data-Science-Project
**Description** :The project revolves around analyzing healthcare data of huge number of people to provide actionable insight, based on the data available, as well as accurately predict which people (customers) will be expensive. The dataset contains healthcare cost information from an HMO (Health Management Organization). Each row in the dataset represents a person. Our goal is to determine why some people are more expensive in terms of heath costs based on different health and lifestyle attributes.    

**Project Scope and Objective**: The scope of this project is to analyze and draw insights from the dataset provided to us which contains data regarding a person’s health based on various factors. The dataset contains healthcare cost information from an HMO (Health Management Organization). Each row in the dataset represents a person. There is data of around 7000 people.
We will be concentrating on achieving two high level goals. Predict people who will spend a lot of money on health care next year (i.e., which people will have high healthcare costs). 
Provide actionable insight to the HMO, in terms of how to lower their total health care costs, by providing a specific recommendation on how to lower health care costs. 
The objective of this project is to suggest our patients, the areas where they can improve to increase their total health care costs. Also, provide them with insights on how to lower health care costs. 

**Data Acquisition**

The data set was made available to us by the course instructors. Before any data munging, this data set consisted of approximately 7583 rows of the people with varied health and lifestyle attributes with 15 fields such as Age, bmi, gender, children, smoker, location, location_type, education_level, yearly_physical etc.
This data was extensively studied to determine the usable variables. After this initial analysis, the data set was forwarded to the preprocessing phase where all the errors in the data were removed in order to make it usable for further analysis.

**Business Questions**

A vast survey of customers flying within the United States was provided which gives information regarding the factors that drive the overall customer satisfaction. Analyzing these factors would help Southeast Airlines to improve their quality and further boost their business.
A vast healthcare and lifestyle data of 7582 people was provided which gives information regarding the factors that drive the overall healthcare cost of that person. Analyzing these factors would help HMO and people to lower their total health care costs.
The business questions that have been recognized and answered through the project are as follows:

1.	How does BMI, Age, Exercise, Smoker impact the overall healthcare costs?

2.	Why do some parameters like children, location, location type, education, married, gender not affect the overall healthcare cost?

3.	Which aspect of person affects the health care cost the most?

4.	How can a customer save on healthcare costs?

5.	What kind of people will spend the most on health care costs?

6.	Why do some people have high healthcare costs?

**Interpretations**
§	HMO can save cost by taking preventive approach as following:
§	Smoking is considered the main factor to drive the cost, Thus, HMO can initiate health campaigns to encourage its customers to cease smoking.
§	HMO also can develop wellness programs to encourage its customer to adopt healthy lifestyles.(Reduce BMI , and become more physically active). The wellness program can include: premium discounts, cash rewards, gym memberships.
§	Higher Insurance plan price for customers aged 60 and above
